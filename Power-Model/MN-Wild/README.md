## Generating Results
The scripts will process the data used for power model generation.

### Requirements
Here are the software/package requirements. The version number in the bracket indicates the minimum version that our script has been tested on.

- Python 3 (3.7.7 and higher)
- Pandas (1.1.3 and higher)

### Running code
The processed logs can be found in `data-processed` folder. 

Note that we have only put the experiment summary file `MN-Wild-Summary.csv` in the `data` folder due to the file size of raw logs. To regenerate all logs, download the data from [google-drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yxmJr3zl5dn81d1LLHwyOI--6l0hOcYE?usp=sharing) and put it in the `data` folder.

To generate the logs from scratch, the following commands can be used. 

```bash
python3 01-Process-Iperf-Logs.py && \
python3 02-Process-5GTracker-Logs.py && \
python3 03-Merge-Walking-Loops.py && \
python3 04-Combine-Walking-Loops.py && \
python3 05-Prepare-Data-Modeling.py
```

The processed logs will be placed in `data-processed` folder. The [Folder Structure](#folder-structure) section gives a detailed overview of all the files in `data-processed` folder.
